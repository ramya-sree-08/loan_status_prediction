📊 Loan Status Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on various applicant attributes using a logistic regression model. It involves data preprocessing, training a machine learning model, and evaluating its performance.

🔍 Problem Statement
Financial institutions face challenges in evaluating loan applications efficiently. This project uses historical loan data to train a classification model that predicts the likelihood of loan approval based on factors such as income, credit history, employment, and more.
